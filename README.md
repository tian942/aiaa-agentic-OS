---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** You just need TWO accounts - Claude will auto-install all tools!
- **GitHub account** - Sign up at https://github.com
- **Railway account** - Sign up at https://railway.app

Claude will automatically install: Homebrew, Python, Git, Node.js, Railway CLI, and the Railway skill.

**Open Claude Code and paste this entire prompt to get started:**

```
I want to set up AIAA Agentic OS v2.3. Please help me through the entire process interactively, asking me ONE question at a time and waiting for my response before moving on.

## Prerequisites Check (Do This FIRST)

Before we begin Step 1, say:

"Before we get started, let me check if you have the required tools installed. I'll automatically install anything that's missing - you don't need to do anything!"

### Step 0a: Check for Homebrew (macOS only)

First, RUN this command to check the operating system:

uname -s

If macOS (Darwin), check if Homebrew is installed by RUNNING:

which brew

If Homebrew is NOT installed (command not found), say "I need to install Homebrew first - this is a package manager that makes installing other tools easy..." and RUN:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

After Homebrew installs, RUN these commands to add it to the PATH:

echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

### Step 0b: Check and Auto-Install Required Tools

Now check each required tool and AUTOMATICALLY install any that are missing:

**Check Python:**
RUN: python3 --version

If Python is NOT installed, say "Installing Python..." and RUN:
- On macOS: brew install python3
- On Linux: sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

**Check Git:**
RUN: git --version

If Git is NOT installed, say "Installing Git..." and RUN:
- On macOS: brew install git
- On Linux: sudo apt-get install -y git

**Check npm/Node.js:**
RUN: npm --version

If npm is NOT installed, say "Installing Node.js (includes npm)..." and RUN:
- On macOS: brew install node
- On Linux: curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

### Step 0c: Install Railway CLI and Railway Skill

After all tools are installed, say "Now I'll install the Railway CLI and Railway skill for easier deployments..."

RUN these commands:

npm install -g @railway/cli
npx add-skill mshumer/claude-skill-railway

### Step 0d: Verify Everything is Ready

RUN these commands to confirm everything is installed:

python3 --version
git --version
npm --version
railway --version

If all 4 commands succeed, say: "All required tools are installed and ready!"

Then ask: "Do you have a Railway account? If not, please:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click 'Sign Up'
3. Connect with GitHub (recommended) or use email
4. Verify your email

Reply 'yes' when you have a Railway account and we'll proceed to Step 1!"

Wait for my response before continuing.

## Step 1: Clone & Install

Say: "Great! Let me download and install AIAA Agentic OS for you..."

Then RUN these commands automatically:

git clone https://github.com/stopmoclay/AIAA-Agentic-OS.git
cd AIAA-Agentic-OS
pip install -r requirements.txt

After running them, tell me if they completed successfully or if there were any errors.

### Step 3d: Download Credentials
1. Click "DOWNLOAD JSON" on the popup
2. Rename to `credentials.json`
3. Move to project root folder

### Step 3e: Test Integration

Say: "Now let me test the Google integration..."

Then RUN this command:

python3 execution/create_google_doc.py --test

Tell me: "A browser window should open asking you to sign in to Google. Please:
1. Select your Google account
2. If you see 'Google hasn't verified this app' - click 'Continue' (it's your own app)
3. Grant permissions for Docs, Sheets, and Drive
4. You'll see 'The authentication flow has completed'

Let me know when you've completed the authentication, or if you see any errors!"

Wait for my response. If successful, confirm the test document was created.

## Step 4: Agency Profile Setup

Ask me questions one at a time to create my agency profile:
1. Agency name?
2. Website URL?
3. Services offered?
4. Target audience?
5. What makes you different?
6. Brand voice?

Save to: context/agency.md, context/brand_voice.md, context/services.md

## Step 5: Deploy AIAA Dashboard to Railway (AUTOMATE THIS)

Deploy my monitoring dashboard. Handle as much as possible automatically:

### 5a: Check Prerequisites

Say: "Let me check if Railway CLI is installed..."

Then RUN this command:

railway --version

If not installed, say "I need to install Railway CLI for you..." and RUN:

npm install -g @railway/cli

Then RUN this command to check if you're logged in:

railway whoami

If not logged in, tell me: "Please run 'railway login' in your terminal and complete the browser authentication, then let me know when done!"

Wait for my response before continuing.

### 5b: Get My Credentials
Ask me TWO questions (one at a time):
1. "What username do you want for your dashboard? (default: admin)"
2. "What password do you want for your dashboard?"

After I provide the password, say "Let me generate the secure password hash..."

Then RUN this command to generate the hash (using heredoc to avoid escape issues):

python3 << 'PYHASH'
import hashlib
password = "THE_PASSWORD_I_GAVE_YOU"
print(hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest())
PYHASH

Save the username and hash - you'll need them for environment variables.

### 5c: Deploy

Say: "Now let me deploy your dashboard to Railway..."

Then RUN these commands:

cd railway_apps/aiaa_dashboard
railway init

Tell me: "When prompted, please select 'Empty Project' and give it a name like 'aiaa-dashboard'. Let me know when that's done!"

Wait for my response.

Then say "Deploying the dashboard code to Railway..." and RUN:

railway up

Tell me when the deployment completes.

### 5d: Set Environment Variables

Say: "Now I'll configure the environment variables..."

First, generate the FLASK_SECRET_KEY by RUNNING:

python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

Then RUN these commands with the username and hash you saved earlier:

railway variables set DASHBOARD_USERNAME="[USERNAME_I_CHOSE]"
railway variables set DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH="[THE_HASH_YOU_GENERATED]"
railway variables set FLASK_SECRET_KEY="[THE_SECRET_KEY_YOU_JUST_GENERATED]"

If I provided API keys in Step 2, also RUN:

railway variables set OPENROUTER_API_KEY="[MY_KEY_FROM_STEP_2]"
railway variables set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="[MY_KEY_FROM_STEP_2]"
railway variables set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="[MY_WEBHOOK_FROM_STEP_2]"

Tell me when all variables are set.

### 5e: Generate Domain & Verify

Say: "Let me generate a public URL for your dashboard..."

Then RUN:

railway domain

Save the generated URL (it will look like: https://aiaa-dashboard-production.up.railway.app)

Then say: "Testing that your dashboard is live..."

RUN (using the domain from above):

curl -s "https://[THE_GENERATED_DOMAIN]/health"

Check if it returns: {"status": "ok", "version": "2.3.0", "workflows": 139}

If successful, tell me "Dashboard is live!" If it fails, wait 30 seconds and try again (deployment may still be starting).

### 5f: Provide Login Details
Once everything is deployed, give me:
- Dashboard URL
- Username
- Password (the one I chose)
- Remind me to bookmark it!

Tell me: "Your AIAA Dashboard is now live! You can monitor all 139 workflows, manage environment variables, and track webhook events."

## Step 6: Test the System

Say: "Let's test the system with a quick workflow!"

Ask me: "What type of agency/business are you? (marketing/content/design/other)"

Based on my answer, RUN one of these test commands:
- If marketing: `python3 execution/write_cold_emails.py --sender "Test" --company "TestCo" --offer "Marketing services" --target "Small businesses"`
- If content: `python3 execution/generate_blog_post.py --topic "Getting started with AI" --length 500`
- If design: Ask for a sample project to research
- If other: `python3 execution/research_company_offer.py --company "Apple" --website "https://apple.com"`

Show me the output file location and tell me if it was successful.

## Step 7: Show What's Available

Give me a quick tour of the 139 workflows:

**Content Creation (25+ workflows):**
