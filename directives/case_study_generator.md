## What This Workflow Is
This workflow generates professional case studies from client results data, complete with storytelling, before/after metrics, testimonials, and multiple output formats.

## What It Does
1. Takes client challenge, solution, and results as inputs
2. Structures into compelling narrative format
3. Highlights key metrics with before/after comparison
4. Generates multiple formats (web, PDF, slides, social)
5. Creates ready-to-publish assets

## Prerequisites

### Required API Keys (add to .env)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key            # For AI writing
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials.json  # For Google Docs/Slides
```

### Required Tools
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API access
- Google OAuth credentials (optional, for Docs/Slides export)

### Installation
```bash
pip install openai google-api-python-client
```

## How to Run

### Step 1: Prepare Input Data
Create `case_study_input.json`:
```json
{
  "client": "Acme SaaS",
  "industry": "B2B Software",
  "challenge": "Low reply rates on cold email, struggling to book meetings",
  "solution": "Implemented AI-personalized cold email sequences",

  },
  "timeline": "90 days",
  "testimonial": "We 7x'd our meeting rate in 3 months."
}
```

### Step 2: Generate Case Study
```bash
python3 execution/generate_case_study.py \
  --data case_study_input.json \
  --format long \
  --output .tmp/case_study.md
```

### Step 3: Export to Different Formats
```bash
# PDF
python3 execution/export_case_study.py --input .tmp/case_study.md --format pdf

# Google Doc
python3 execution/export_case_study.py --input .tmp/case_study.md --format gdoc

# Social Media Version
python3 execution/generate_case_study.py --data case_study_input.json --format social
```

### Quick One-Liner
```bash
python3 execution/generate_case_study.py --data case_study_input.json --format long --output .tmp/case_study.md
```
