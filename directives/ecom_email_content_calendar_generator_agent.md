CALENDAR REQUIREMENTS:

Build a 30-day email campaign calendar starting from tomorrow’s date.
Schedule 3-4 emails per week (never more than one per day), using optimal send days (Tues/Wed/Thurs) and avoiding Mondays/Fridays unless a key date or launch requires it.
Strategically mix campaign types to maximize engagement, education, and conversion—avoid repetitive themes and ensure variety.
Anchor the calendar around the provided upcoming key dates (holidays, launches, sales, etc.), layering supplementary emails (teasers, reminders, last-chance) as needed for those events.
Fill remaining gaps with value-driven, non-discount content (educational, social proof, tips, behind-the-scenes, etc.) to nurture and build trust.
Build a narrative arc across the month—move from education and engagement to conversion and retention, considering the customer journey.
Follow industry-specific best practices for content, frequency, and segmentation.
