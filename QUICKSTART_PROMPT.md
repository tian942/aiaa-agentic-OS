## Step 3: Google Drive, Docs & Sheets Setup (Recommended)

This enables automatic document creation, lead exports to Sheets, and file management. Walk me through the complete setup:

---

### Why This Matters

Google integration powers these workflows:
- **Auto-create Google Docs** from generated content (VSL scripts, sales pages, emails)
- **Export leads to Sheets** from scraping workflows
- **Meeting prep documents** created automatically from Calendly webhooks
- **Client deliverables** formatted and shared via Google Drive

---

### Step 3a: Create Google Cloud Project

2. Click the project dropdown (top left, next to "Google Cloud")
3. Click "NEW PROJECT" (top right of popup)
4. Name it "AIAA Agentic OS" 
5. Click "CREATE"
6. Wait for project creation (takes 10-30 seconds)
7. Make sure the new project is selected in the dropdown

---

### Step 3b: Enable Required APIs

1. In the left sidebar, click "APIs & Services" → "Library"
2. Search for and enable EACH of these APIs (click each one, then click "ENABLE"):

**Required APIs:**
- **Google Docs API** - For creating/editing documents
- **Google Sheets API** - For spreadsheet exports

For each API:
1. Search the name in the API Library
2. Click on the API
3. Click the blue "ENABLE" button
4. Wait for it to enable, then go back and enable the next one

---

### Step 3c: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. In the left sidebar, click "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" (top of page)
3. Select "OAuth client ID"

**If you see "Configure Consent Screen" warning:**
1. Click "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"
2. Select "External" (unless you have Google Workspace, then "Internal")
3. Click "CREATE"
4. Fill in required fields:
   - App name: "AIAA Agentic OS"
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact: Your email
5. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"
6. On Scopes page, click "SAVE AND CONTINUE" (no changes needed)
7. On Test Users page, click "ADD USERS"
8. Add your Gmail address
9. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"
10. Click "BACK TO DASHBOARD"
11. Go back to Credentials and create OAuth client ID again

**Create the OAuth Client:**
1. Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" → "OAuth client ID"
2. Application type: Select "Desktop app"
3. Name: "AIAA Desktop Client"
4. Click "CREATE"

---

### Step 3d: Download and Place Credentials

1. After creating, you'll see a popup with your Client ID
2. Click "DOWNLOAD JSON" button
3. Rename the downloaded file to exactly: `credentials.json`
4. Move it to your AIAA project root folder:
   ```
   AIAA-Agentic-OS/
   ├── credentials.json    ← Place it here
   ├── directives/
   ├── execution/
   └── ...
   ```

---

### Step 3e: Test the Integration

Say: "Now let me test the Google integration..."

Then RUN this command:
```bash
python3 execution/create_google_doc.py --test
```

Tell me: "A browser window should open asking you to sign in to Google. Please:
1. Select your Google account
2. If you see 'Google hasn't verified this app' - click 'Continue' (it's your own app)
3. Grant permissions for Docs, Sheets, and Drive
4. You'll see 'The authentication flow has completed'

Let me know when you've completed the authentication, or if you see any errors!"

Wait for my response. If successful, confirm the test document was created.

---

### Troubleshooting Google Setup

**"credentials.json not found"**
- Make sure the file is named exactly `credentials.json` (not `credentials (1).json`)
- Make sure it's in the project root, not a subfolder

**"Access blocked" or "App not verified"**
- Click "Advanced" → "Go to AIAA Agentic OS (unsafe)"
- This is safe - it's your own app

**"Token has been expired or revoked"**
- Delete `token.pickle` and `token_docs.json` files
- Run the test command again to re-authenticate

**"API not enabled"**
- Go back to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Library
- Make sure all 3 APIs are enabled (Docs, Sheets, Drive)

---

## Step 4: Agency Profile Setup

Ask me questions one at a time and create my agency profile:

Questions to ask:
1. What's your agency name?
2. What's your website URL?
3. What services do you offer? (list them)
4. Who is your ideal client/target audience?
5. What makes you different from competitors?
6. Describe your brand voice (professional, casual, bold, friendly, authoritative, etc.)
7. Who is the owner/founder? (name and background)

Save to these files:
- context/agency.md - Agency overview
- context/brand_voice.md - Tone and style guide
- context/services.md - Service offerings
- context/owner.md - Founder info

## Step 5: First Client Profile (Optional)

Ask if I want to set up a client profile. If yes, create clients/{client_name}/ with:
- profile.md - Company info, industry, audience
- rules.md - Content guidelines
- preferences.md - Style preferences

## Step 6: Deploy AIAA Dashboard to Railway (IMPORTANT - AUTOMATE THIS)

This is the key step. Deploy my monitoring dashboard to Railway. Handle as much as possible automatically.

### Step 6a: Check Prerequisites

Say: "Let me check if Railway CLI is installed..."

Then RUN this command:
```bash
railway --version
```

If not installed, say "I need to install Railway CLI for you..." and RUN:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

Then RUN this command to check if you're logged in:
```bash
railway whoami
```

If not logged in, tell me: "Please run 'railway login' in your terminal and complete the browser authentication, then let me know when done!"

Wait for my response before continuing.

### Step 6b: Ask for Dashboard Credentials
Ask me TWO questions (one at a time):
1. "What username do you want for your dashboard? (default: admin)"
2. "What password do you want for your dashboard?"

After I provide the password, say "Let me generate the secure password hash..."

Then RUN this command to generate the hash (using heredoc to avoid escape issues):
```bash
python3 << 'PYHASH'
import hashlib
password = "THE_PASSWORD_I_GAVE_YOU"
print(hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest())
PYHASH
```

Save the username and hash - you'll need them for environment variables.

### Step 6c: Create Railway Project and Deploy

Say: "Now let me deploy your dashboard to Railway..."

Then RUN these commands:

```bash
cd railway_apps/aiaa_dashboard
railway init
```

Tell me: "When prompted, please select 'Empty Project' and give it a name like 'aiaa-dashboard'. Let me know when that's done!"

Wait for my response.

Then say "Deploying the dashboard code to Railway..." and RUN:
```bash
railway up
```

Tell me when the deployment completes.

### Step 6d: Set Environment Variables

Say: "Now I'll configure the environment variables..."

First, generate the FLASK_SECRET_KEY by RUNNING:
```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Then RUN these commands with the username and hash you saved earlier:
```bash
railway variables set DASHBOARD_USERNAME="[USERNAME_I_CHOSE]"
railway variables set DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH="[THE_HASH_YOU_GENERATED]"
railway variables set FLASK_SECRET_KEY="[THE_SECRET_KEY_YOU_JUST_GENERATED]"
```

If I provided API keys in Step 2, also RUN:
```bash
railway variables set OPENROUTER_API_KEY="[MY_KEY_FROM_STEP_2]"
railway variables set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="[MY_KEY_FROM_STEP_2]"
railway variables set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="[MY_WEBHOOK_FROM_STEP_2]"
```

Tell me when all variables are set.

### Step 6e: Generate Public Domain

Say: "Let me generate a public URL for your dashboard..."

Then RUN:
```bash
railway domain
```

Save the generated URL (it will look like: https://aiaa-dashboard-production.up.railway.app)

### Step 6f: Verify Deployment

Say: "Testing that your dashboard is live..."

Then RUN (using the domain from Step 6e):
```bash
curl -s "https://[THE_GENERATED_DOMAIN]/health"
```

Check if it returns: {"status": "ok", "version": "2.3.0", "workflows": 139}

If successful, tell me "Dashboard is live!" If it fails, wait 30 seconds and try again (deployment may still be starting).

### Step 6g: Provide Login Details
Once everything is deployed, give me:
- Dashboard URL
- Username
- Password (the one I chose)
- Remind me to bookmark it!

Tell me: "Your AIAA Dashboard is now live! You can monitor all 139 workflows, manage environment variables, and track webhook events."

## Step 7: Test the System

Say: "Let's test the system with a quick workflow!"

Ask me: "What type of agency/business are you? (marketing/content/design/other)"

Based on my answer, RUN one of these test commands:
- If marketing: `python3 execution/write_cold_emails.py --sender "Test" --company "TestCo" --offer "Marketing services" --target "Small businesses"`
- If content: `python3 execution/generate_blog_post.py --topic "Getting started with AI" --length 500`
- If design: Ask for a sample project to research
- If other: `python3 execution/research_company_offer.py --company "Apple" --website "https://apple.com"`

Show me the output file location and tell me if it was successful.

## Step 8: Show What's Available

Give me a quick tour of the 139 workflows:

**Content Creation (25+ workflows):**
- Blog posts, LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads
- YouTube scripts, Instagram Reels
- Email newsletters, Content calendars

**Sales & Funnels (30+ workflows):**

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

### Deploy
```bash
cd railway_apps/aiaa_dashboard
railway init
railway up
```

### Configure
```bash
# Generate password hash (use heredoc to avoid escape sequence issues)
python3 << 'PYHASH'
import hashlib
password = "your-password"
print(hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest())
PYHASH

# Set variables
railway variables set DASHBOARD_USERNAME="admin"
railway variables set DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH="your-hash-here"
railway variables set FLASK_SECRET_KEY="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')"

# Generate domain
railway domain
```

### Verify
```bash
curl https://your-domain.up.railway.app/health
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "railway: command not found"
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### "Not logged in"
```bash
railway login
```
Complete browser authentication.

### "No project linked"
```bash
railway init
```
Select "Empty Project" when prompted.

### Dashboard shows "Invalid credentials"
Regenerate password hash using heredoc (avoids escape sequence issues with special characters):
```bash
python3 << 'PYHASH'
import hashlib
password = "your-password"
print(hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest())
PYHASH

railway variables set DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH="new-hash"
```

### Health check fails
Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete, then retry:
```bash
railway logs
```
